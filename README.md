## BLE Dataset

### Data

We provide the BLE localization dataset collected in the real world experimental scenario. A total of 21 BLE gateways are deployed to collect the RSSI of BLE beacons. The RSSI is set to -100 dBm if the gateway does not detect any signal from the beacon. The dataset has a total of 6K records, which can [download here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VbbmQx0inZOedKtWkQZGILoh7B9qDchi?usp=sharing).
